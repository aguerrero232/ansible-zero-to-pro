## **Description** üëÄ
`Playbooks` are written in `yaml`, and are the ***main*** way to automate `Ansible`.

* `play`: defines the set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts
* `task`: an action to be performed on the host
  * *i.e*: execute a command, run a script, install a package

<br />

## **Generics** üìù

* **execute** an `ansible playbook`

    ```shell
    ansible-playbook <path-to/playbook.yml> -i <path-to/inventory.txt>
    ```

* `playbook.yaml`

    ```yaml
    -
        name: <play name>
        hosts: <host-pattern>
        tasks:
            - name: <task name>
              <module>:
                <module-args>
    ```


<br />


## **Examples** üß©

* sample playbook

    ```yaml
    -
        name: Play 1
        hosts: all

              command: test_script.sh
            - name: install httpd service
              yum:
                name: httpd
                state: present
            - name: start web server
              service:
